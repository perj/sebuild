Collects the names of final targets into one or more variables that can later
be used as a sources in other descriptors.

In this example `$all_confs` will contain `$destroot/conf/a/x.conf`,
`$destroot/conf/a/y.conf` and `$destroot/conf/b/x.conf`, `$a_confs` will
contain `$destroot/conf/a/x.conf` and `$destroot/conf/y.conf`. Notice that the
variables will be expanded when generating the ninja files to get proper
dependencies (and because ninja treats variables as one file, never a list).

As a special rule, all targets generated by GOTEST are collected like with
`collect_target_var`, but in special variables:

 * `$_gotest` collects test targets
 * `$_gobench` collects benchmark targets
 * `$_gocover` collects coverage targets (the html output)

This makes it easier to invoke all registers go tests.
