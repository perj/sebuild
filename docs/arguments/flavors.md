## flavors

    flavors[dev]

Limits the building of this descriptor to certain flavors.
This is deprecated and superseded by the [enabled](enabled.md) argument which
does much of the same and more.

The [COMPONENT descriptor](../descriptors/component.md) does however not yet
support the enabled argument so this is still used for that descriptor.
