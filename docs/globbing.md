# Globbing

Whenever an argument accepts real source files those source files can also be
given with a `*`-glob. Seb will keep dependencies correct and react when the
source directory changes. Globbing only works on real source files that exist
in source directories. Any files generated by intermediate steps will still
have to be specified with full name. The current arguments that support globs
are: `srcs`, the source part of `specialsrcs`, `conf` and `scripts`. Example:

    TOOL_PROG(tpc
        srcs[*.yy *.ll *.cc]
        libs[pcre platform_util]
        copts[-Wno-unused]
    )

Globbing is guaranteed to remove duplicate source files and preserve order.

Globbing adds a dependency on the directory containing the glob. This is done
such that new files matching the glob can be detected. If your editor writes
temporary files in this directory this might create a spurious rebuild whenever
you open your editor.
