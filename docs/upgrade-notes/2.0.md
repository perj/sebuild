# Upgrade Notes for 2.0

## Invars

The invars file has been remodeled. You now configure it using the
[invars](../descriptors/config.md#invars) parameter in CONFIG, instead of in a
configvars.ninja. Sebuild will concatenate buildvars, configvars, the builtin
invars script and the ones specified in CONFIG. Thus there's no longer any need
to use `source` or `depend` in your invars.sh. The `setval` and `depend`
functions are still around and work as usual.

While the `inconfig` variable in configvars still work, you should remove it
and instead put the same file in the `invars` parameter in CONFIG.

The builtin invars script can be overridden either with the `SEBUILD_INVARS_SH`
environment variable or by the
[builtin_invars](../descriptors/config.md#builtin_invars) parameter in CONFIG.
