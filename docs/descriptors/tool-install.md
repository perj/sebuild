# Other Build Tools - TOOL_INSTALL

     TOOL_INSTALL(perl_xs_compiler
             srcs[perl_xs_compiler.in]
             scripts[perl_xs_compiler]
     )

`TOOL_INSTALL` is just like `INSTALL` with one major difference: non binary
tools get installed under tool/ and the target argument is the script name
instead of the target directory. This descriptor is used to install build tools
that are either static scripts or autogenerated scripts from a `.in` file.
The `name` argument is currently ignored since the destination directory is
always `tool/`.
